My github account was created to further my learning about coding and source control

The repository sdclark74.github.io was created while learning the fundamentals of github and source control. It will be added to in future lessons as I learn more

The repository was cloned by clicking "clone repository" on Github Desktop. Then it was a matter of choosing where on my computer I wanted to save the clone. I chose to create a new folder specifically for Github related materials.
